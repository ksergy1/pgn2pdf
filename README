Hands up all of you who have an electronic book reader! Almost everyone! I have one too. Yet, I like to play chess. I like to analyze my own games with others. And I'd like to analyze other's chess games (like ones of William Steinitz).
I've tired to sit at that old and rusty blinking screen my PC or laptop.
I know LaTeX a little and I thought "Why not?".
So here it is - a simple application to convert pgn (now many games in one file) to LaTeX and a script that will allow you to automate convertation and running pdflatex to retreive a pdf file that you will be able to read on electronic book reader. The genereated pdf-file will be looking just like that chessboard you have. Hope, you'll like it.

Use pgn2pdf.sh script to do the thing. Compile a couple of binaries with Makefile in order script to work properly ;-)
